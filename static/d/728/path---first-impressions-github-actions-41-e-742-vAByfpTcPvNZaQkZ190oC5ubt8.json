{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>A few weeks ago Github published <a href=\"https://github.com/features/actions\">Github Actions</a>. In the beginning, the feature was accessible only for private repositories, but they just released it for public ones. I wanted to give it a try and what better project than my personal blog to try new technologies, I decided to move the deployment of my blog to Github Actions.</p>\n<p>It's easy to start you have a UI where you can add basic actions like running npm scripts, but to deploy my blogs I used the npm module <code>gh-pages</code> that rely on having git installed on the machine, and it was not the case with the default npm Github action.</p>\n<p>I decided to implement my own action to deploy to Github pages. You just need to create a GitHub repository with a <code>Dockerfile</code> inside. When GitHub is going to execute your action the repo and results of previous actions are going to be mount in <code>/github/workspace</code>.</p>\n<p>The result is here <a href=\"https://github.com/nchaulet/github-action-gh-pages\">My first github action</a>.</p>\n<p>And this blog is now deployed using github actions (<a href=\"https://github.com/nchaulet/blog/blob/master/.github/main.workflow\">see workflow</a>).</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-12-21","path":"/first-impressions-github-actions","title":"First impressions with github actions"}}},"pageContext":{}}
