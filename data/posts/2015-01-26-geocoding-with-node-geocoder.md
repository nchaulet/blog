After more than a year of developing `node-geocoder` library, I finally take the time to write a small article to present you this library.

Node geocoder is a node.js module which provides an abstraction layer for geocoding and reverse geocoding.

## Usage

To install the module it's really easy : just run the following command to get the latest version:
```shell
npm install node-geocoder
```
Then you can geocode your first address :
```javascript
// Require the module
var NodeGeocoder = require('node-geocoder');
// Choose a geocoder provider
var geocoder = NodeGeocoder.get('google');

// Geocode
geocoder.geocode('Your adress')
	.then(function(result) {
    	console.log(result);
    });
```

## Future of node-geocoder


* More provider: Currently this library supports 11 geocoding providers. In a near future new providers will appear.
* Better error handling: I am currently refactoring error handling to be more debugable.
* A logo ?
