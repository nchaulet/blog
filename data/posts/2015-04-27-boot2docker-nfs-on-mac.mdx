Boot2docker is a really great tool to run docker on a mac computer, but the default option to share folders is `vboxfs`, which can be an issue.


`Vboxfs` is really slow and you may encounter access and performance issues.

A good solution is to use `nfs` to share your folders.

## How to share your folders

On OSX, run the following comands:

```shell
sudo echo "/Users -mapall=`whoami`:staff `boot2docker ip`" | sudo tee -a /etc/exports
```

```shell
sudo nfsd restart
```

## To mount a folder on boot2docker VM

Connect yourself to your boot2docker vm using ssh
```shell
boot2docker ssh
```

Then run the following:

```shell
sudo su
echo "#! /bin/sh
sleep 1
sudo umount /Users
sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/nfs-client start
sudo mount 192.168.59.3:/Users /Users -o rw,async,noatime,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,proto=tcp" > /var/lib/boot2docker/bootlocal.sh
sudo chmod a+x /var/lib/boot2docker/bootlocal.sh
exit
exit
```

Now that the above is done, restart your boot2docker vm
```shell
boot2docker restart
```
